  <p>On the corner of Suffolk and Rivington lies the Stop One Deli. It's one of four convient shops, or bodegas, within a one block radius.  </p> <p>As a family owned establishment, The Stop 1 Deli has functioned since 1982. </p>

  <i><p class="cap"><b>Above:</b> Carlos working behind the deli counter. </p></i><p>Carlos Bedesus, 29, works behide the sandwich bar listening to the radio. His hands are covered by opaque gloves and his clothes are visible but also covered by an apron. He wears black brimmed glasses, Dolce & Gabanna glasses, and diamond studs the size of a macadamian nut.</p>
  <p> Bedesus has worked at the S1D for six months now, and seems to be right at home. Everyday he commutes from Staten Island to the Lower East Side for work. </p>

<p>"It takes about 35-40 minutes because I drive," Bedesus said. "It usually takes longer in the day, but when I leave at night I get home pretty quickly."</p>
  
 
  
  <p>As the Lower East side invites a number of new buildings into the area, the price of rent rises, pushing people who can't afford it out while bringing in wealthier folks. </p> 
  
  <p>When Bedesus was asked what he thought about the gentrification in the area he made a point in saying there's good and bad to it. </p>
  
  <p>The bad being the rising rent, and the good being it's bringing in smarter people, according to Bedesus.</p>
  
  <p>On the other end of the spectrum is the manager Josefine Rodriguez. In an <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/03/10/518376170/new-york-city-bodegas-and-the-generations-who-love-them" target="_blank">interview with NPR</a>, she spoke about how she believes that with all of the new, the old is getting pushed out. </p>

  <p>"We're Spanish people. We got to keep our culture and our things together," she says. "You can't just get rid of pepole just like that."</p>
